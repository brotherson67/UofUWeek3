I'm going to attach each dom element to a js variable. 

if an element is changed I don't want the page to change until the sumbit buttonis selected.

when the submit button is changed I don't want the changed elements to revert to previous state


RIGHT NOW THE MAIN ISSUE IS NOT HAVING THE PAGE REFRESH BEFORE THE PASSWORD IS SHOWN
ITS OK IF IT RESETS THE CHECKLIST ITEMS
